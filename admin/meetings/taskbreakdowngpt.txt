Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of tasks for each part of the project:

---

### **1. Card Deck and Playing Card Web Components**
**Goal:** Create reusable web components for the card deck and individual playing cards, including animations for flipping and shuffling.

#### Tasks:
- **HTML:**
  - Create a `Card` web component with a front and back face.
  - Create a `Deck` web component to hold multiple cards.

- **CSS:**
  - Design the card's appearance (e.g., size, suits, and ranks).
  - Add animations for card flipping (e.g., CSS transitions or keyframes).
  - Add animations for shuffling the deck.

- **JavaScript:**
  - Implement the `Card` component logic (e.g., flipping the card programmatically).
  - Implement the `Deck` component logic (e.g., shuffling cards programmatically).
  - Ensure components are reusable and modular.

- **Testing:**
  - Test animations for smoothness and responsiveness.
  - Verify that the card and deck components render correctly in different browsers.

### **2. Dealing with the Deck and State Management**
**Goal:** Implement functionality to deal cards from the deck and manage the state of the deck.

#### Tasks:
- **JavaScript:**
  - Write a function to shuffle the deck programmatically.
  - Write a function to deal one or multiple cards from the deck.
  - Implement state management for the deck (e.g., track remaining cards, dealt cards).
  - Add functionality to reset the deck to its original state.

- **Web APIs:**
  - Use local storage or session storage to persist deck state between sessions (optional).

- **Integration:**
  - Connect the `Deck` component to the state management logic.
  - Ensure dealt cards are visually removed from the deck.

- **Testing:**
  - Test dealing functionality for edge cases (e.g., dealing more cards than available).
  - Verify that the deck state updates correctly after each action.

### **3. Simple Game (Solitaire or BlackJack)**
**Goal:** Build a simple card game with an algorithmic dealer and game logic.

#### Tasks:
- **Game Logic:**
  - **For Solitaire:**
    - Implement rules for card movement (e.g., stacking cards by suit or rank).
    - Add win condition detection.
  - **For BlackJack:**
    - Implement rules for player and dealer turns.
    - Add logic for calculating hand values.
    - Implement dealer modes (random, brain-dead, correct).
    - Add state tracking for player money (e.g., bets, wins, losses).

- **UI/UX:**
  - Create a game board layout (e.g., table for BlackJack or stacks for Solitaire).
  - Add buttons for player actions (e.g., "Hit", "Stand", "Deal").
  - Display game state (e.g., player score, dealer score, remaining money).

- **JavaScript:**
  - Write functions for game initialization and resetting.
  - Implement event listeners for player actions.
  - Integrate the card and deck components into the game.

- **Testing:**
  - Test game logic for correctness (e.g., valid moves, win/loss conditions).
  - Verify that the UI updates correctly based on game state.

### **General Tasks:**
- **Documentation:**
  - Write a README file with setup instructions and usage details.
  - Document the API for the card and deck components.

- **Version Control:**
  - Set up a Git repository and establish a branching strategy.
  - Regularly commit and push changes.

- **Code Review:**
  - Schedule code reviews to ensure quality and consistency.

- **Final Testing:**
  - Test the entire application for bugs and performance issues.
  - Ensure compatibility across different browsers and devices.

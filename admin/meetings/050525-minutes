## Agenda:
- Leadership vacancy
  - Tony told me (Vivian) we could either choose another leader, or I can remain the leader but one other person must attend the weekly check-in meetings, which are at 3:45PM on Zoom
- Scaling down project MVP (minimum viable product)
> Maybe a pre-set (non-rogue-lite) story path with minimal randomization (like drawing from your deck) and minimal user-input variation (like card plays and choosing cards to add to the deck).

## Present members:

## Minutes:
Item 1: Leadership vacancy
- Mitchell to come to this Wednesday's meeting, 3:45PM

Item 2: Project pitch
- No tree progression but linear
- Less randomization: Still random, less options
- Less cards, multiples of the same basic card
- MVP: A working single battle
- Account for different screen sizes

Item 3: Deadlines
- Help us stay on track
- Every task will have a date attached that it should be done by
- Soft goal: Be testing the game by week 9

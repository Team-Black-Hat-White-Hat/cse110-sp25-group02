## Agenda
- Narrow specifications
- Decide on general project structure
- Build flowcharts of gameflow

---

## Project Decision
Possible Project Ideas:
1. Player vs Computer Game
2. Card Collection App
3. Tarot Game (Fortune Teller based on card chosen)

Voting Outcome:  
After discussion and voting, the majority decision is to build a player vs computer game.

---

## Themes Considered
- Marvel
- Legends of Runeterra
- Yu-Gi-Oh
- Slay the Spire

---

## Key Game Constraints
- Each card will have only two stats:
  - Health
  - Attack

---

## Additional Project Constraints
- No complex animations (keep graphics simple)
- Limited number of items
- Concrete branches/paths (players will have a limited and clear set of choices)
- Simplified equipment system

---

## Game Inspiration
The game design and mechanics will be inspired by *Slay the Spire*.

---

## Unique Selling Point
- Incorporating UCSD themes into the game:
  - School-specific jokes
  - Events related to UCSD culture
  - Characters and cards inspired by campus life
  - "Running jokes" among students will inspire card designs

---

## Concerns
Concern:  
Building an AI that plays smartly may be too complex for the scope of the project.

Solution:  
Instead of making the computer player smarter, we will balance the difficulty by giving the computer stronger cards than the player.

---

## Next Steps
- Flesh out core mechanics for battle
- Gather UCSD-specific inside jokes and common references
- Draft initial card ideas and event scenarios
- Design initial flowchart for gameflow
- Fill out project proposal

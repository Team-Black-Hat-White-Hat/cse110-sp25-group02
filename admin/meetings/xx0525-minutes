## Agenda:
- Leadership vacancy
  - Tony told me (Vivian) we could either choose another leader, or I can remain the leader but one other person must attend the weekly check-in meetings, which are at 3:45PM on Zoom
- Scaling down project MVP (minimum viable product)
> Maybe a pre-set (non-rogue-lite) story path with minimal randomization (like drawing from your deck) and minimal user-input variation (like card plays and choosing cards to add to the deck).

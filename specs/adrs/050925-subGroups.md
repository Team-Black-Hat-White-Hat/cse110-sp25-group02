## Context and Problem Statement
Since an 11-person team is too large to manage effectively, we’ve decided to split into three subgroups.



## Decision Outcome
We’ve divided the 11 members into the following three subgroups. The group leaders are shown in bold.
 1. **Vivian Yu**
    - Saumya Sadh
    - AJ Hermosillo
 2. **Mitchell Moundraty**
    - Alex Acevedo
    - Evgenii Ruzin
    - Victoria Timofeev
 
 3. **Yunsong Yang**
    - Raeed Bourai
    - Joshua Pham
    - Rommel Cabotaje
 
## Consequences
- Good: TBD
- Bad: TBD
